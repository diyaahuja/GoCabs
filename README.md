# GoCabs
Created a high-fidelity prototype as part of a project for the course Human-Computer Interaction (DES-101), depicting the UI and UX for an app named GoCabs that compares the nearest cabs available on different platforms like Ola, Uber, etc. (or local taxi services registered on the app) and provides the most suitable option according to the filters set by the user.
